**Dash Uber Rides Demo**

This is a demo of the Dash interactive Python framework developed by [Plotly](https://plot.ly/).

Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols required to build an interactive web-based application and is a simple and effective way to bind a user interface around your Python code.

This demo is based off of data provided by [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-tlc-foil-response/tree/master/uber-trip-data) and highlights Uber trips taken in New York City from April 2014 to September 2014.
